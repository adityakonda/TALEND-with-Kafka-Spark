1. Purpose

This SOP describes how to use the Solr log analysis script to analyze Solr INFO logs and extract insights related to:

Query patterns

Sort patterns

Query execution time (QTime)

Collection-level performance behavior

The report helps identify frequently executed queries, slow-running queries, and performance hotspots across Solr collections.


Step 1: Gather the logs

Collect the Solr INFO logs from all Solr nodes and place them in the directory configured in the script. The folder path is already defined in the main method, so make sure the logs are copied to that location before running the script.

Step 2: Verify the log location in the script

Open the script and confirm that the folder path in the main method points to the correct directory where the logs are stored. Update the path only if the log location has changed.

Step 3: Run the script

Open a terminal, navigate to the directory where the script is located, and run it:

python solr_log_analyzer.py


Since the log folder path is already configured in the script, no additional arguments are required.

Step 4: Review the output

After the script completes, review the generated output files. These files contain summarized query patterns, sort patterns, and QTime statistics grouped by collection.
